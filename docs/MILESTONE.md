  Summary of Priority

  IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES:

  2. Admin panel completion
  3. Delivery partner portal
  4. Coupon management system

  MEDIUM PRIORITY:
  5. Wishlist feature
  6. Real-time tracking
  7. Return/exchange management
  8. Inventory alerts automation

  LOWER PRIORITY:
  9. Advanced search
  10. Loyalty programs

  main gaps are in customer convenience features (cart, wishlist) and operational features (delivery partner portal,      
  admin panel completion).
